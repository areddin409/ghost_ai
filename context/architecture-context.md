# Architecture Context

> [!info] Purpose
> Stack, system boundaries, storage model, auth model, AI generation model, and invariants for Ghost AI.

## Stack

| Layer            | Technology              | Role                                                           |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Framework        | Next.js 16 + TypeScript | Full-stack app with server/client boundaries                   |
| UI               | Tailwind + shadcn/ui    | Component composition and styling                              |
| Auth             | Clerk                   | User identity and route protection                             |
| Database         | Prisma + PostgreSQL     | Relational metadata: projects, collaborators, specs, task runs |
| Canvas           | Liveblocks + React Flow | Real-time collaborative canvas, presence, and cursors          |
| Background tasks | Trigger.dev             | Durable AI generation workflows                                |
| Artifact storage | Vercel Blob             | Canvas snapshots and generated Markdown specs                  |

## System Boundaries

- `app/api` — Authenticated request handlers: input validation, ownership checks, task triggering, and persistence.
- `trigger` — Long-running background jobs: AI design generation and spec generation.
- `lib` — Shared infrastructure: Prisma client, access control helpers, and utilities.
- `components` — UI composition: canvas surfaces, sidebars, dialogs, and interactive elements.
- `prisma` — Database schema and generated client output.
- `data` — Legacy local directory. Not used for new artifacts.

## Storage Model

- **Database**: metadata, ownership, relationships, and task run records.
- **Vercel Blob**: generated artifacts — canvas snapshots at `canvas/{projectId}.json` and specs at `specs/{projectId}/{specId}.md`.
- Project records, spec records, and task run records belong in PostgreSQL.
- Canvas content and Markdown output are stored in and retrieved from Vercel Blob.
- The blob URL is stored in the database (`canvasJsonPath`, `filePath`) as the reference to the artifact.

## Auth and Collaboration Model

- Every project has a single owner (Clerk user ID).
- Projects can include additional collaborators.
- Only authenticated users can access protected routes.
- Only the owner or a collaborator can mutate project resources.
- Liveblocks room tokens are issued only after verifying project membership.

## Starter System Designs

- Prebuilt templates are static canvas snapshots stored in the codebase.
- Templates are loaded into the active Liveblocks room when a user imports one.
- Import can occur on canvas creation or from within the editor at any time.
- Template data follows the same node/edge schema as user-created canvas content.
- Templates do not require a separate database record; they are resolved by template ID at import time.

## AI Generation Model

### Design Generation

- Input: user prompt, project context, and current canvas state.
- Execution: durable background task via Trigger.dev.
- Output: structured node and edge updates written into the shared Liveblocks room.

### Spec Generation

- Input: current canvas graph and project context.
- Execution: durable background task via Trigger.dev.
- Output: Markdown technical spec saved to the filesystem and linked to the project in the database.

## Invariants

> [!warning] Request handlers stay thin
> Long-lived AI work belongs in background tasks, not in request handlers.

> [!warning] Storage layers are separate
> Metadata and large generated artifacts must not be stored in the same layer. Database for metadata; Vercel Blob for artifacts.

> [!warning] Auth and ownership are always enforced
> Every mutation boundary must verify auth and project ownership before proceeding.

> [!warning] Client components are the exception
> Default to React Server Components. Add `"use client"` only when the component needs browser interactivity, hooks, or real-time state.

> [!warning] Canvas schema is shared
> User-created canvas content and imported templates must use the same node/edge schema. Never diverge them.
